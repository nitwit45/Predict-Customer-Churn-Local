The project's objective is to identify credit card customers who are most likely to churn. Customer churn refers to customers discontinuing their use of a product or service or leaving a business. Predicting churn allows for targeted interventions, such as special discounts or follow-ups, to retain customers and prevent revenue loss. The project adheres to coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for software development, emphasizing modularity, documentation, and testing. The model used in the project demonstrates outstanding accuracy and good sensitivity. Methods of Explainable AI (XAI) are applied to ensure that the model's decision-making process is transparent and reliable, building trust in its predictions. On the backend, predictions are made using two models: a Random Forest classifier and a Logistic Regression classifier.

## We gotta check whether this problem falls under our domain.

Output images can be checked inside images and the models folders

To run the project python==3.8 is required

## Setup - Guide (Keep in mind these steps are for a bash terminal)

pip install -r requirements_py3.8.txt 

python3 churn_library.py

The model will take a while to train (3-8 minutes on my end)
